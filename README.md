# iCloud Status
Removed from sales April, 2013. This is an archive of the application and hasn't been updated leading up to its App Store removal in 2013. It has been left in an unrefined and experimental state.

## A better way to see that status of Apple Web Services
An experiment to use UICollectionViews, Animations, and Modern design to present information from Apple's Service Status page in an easily digestable format.

This app still runs and works fine and can be used for internal or personal use.
* An update will be coming to suppose the status bar changes that occurred with iOS 7.
